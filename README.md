# Final Greenfoot Project: Raging Battlestation

#### About the game
My program is a multiplayer shooting game where the two players goal is to defeat each other. Players can move up, down, left, and right, but can only shoot bullets that travel left and right. Both players start with 6 lives, and when hit by a bullet, they lose a life. First player to get the other player to zero lives is the victor.

#### Getting Started
Start the game by pressing the space bar after both players have read the instructions on the titlescreen. Have fun!!!
